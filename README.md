# Project Name
## CAESAR CIPHER

## By Vivian Muthoni

## Description of project
This project implements the Caesar Cipher using Java.
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.


# Project Setup Instructions
- Clone the Repository in your IDE. 
- Install all dependencies, and you should be good to go.



# BDD
Using a key, which is an integer between 1 and 25, This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".



# Technologies Used
